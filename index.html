                <p class="paragraph">After the advent of internet, there has been an explosion of knowledge. There is no possibility of students coming up with excuses on lack of information in the ever increasing competition. Prathibha Group of Institutions understood this importance very early and established a repository of books.

                    We have a large collection of reference books on advanced disciplines that are aimed at developing students beyond their curriculum. It not only consists of textbooks but also various newspapers, reference books and an archival of editorial clippings and important articles compiled on various interesting subjects.
                    
                    The college library plays a central role in helping us achieve the mission of providing students a quality education. Beyond its immediate responsibility to provide the information services and resources that support the courses of study offered at the college, the library has the broader mission of fostering in our students the importance and necessity of lifelong learning.</p>
